1. make desktop format into a 3 panel display 
- for meyersa home this would just be so there is a runner track for the soc links 
- for other sites this could show recent posts on home 

2. make social links float to row in the middle after title page on mobile home 

3. make it so the other homes are folders 
- writeups
- photography
- projects 

4. get rid of dynamic thing for home info, this should only be for posts
