# Lisbon 
One of the oldest cities in Western Europe—older than Rome—and was founded by Phoenicians around 1200 BCE. Since then it's gone through a lot, but maintained its history.

Being an old city, there was no lack of churches.

# Évora
A UNESCO World Heritage Site, once a Roman city—Liberalitas Julia.

Évora features Capela dos Ossos, or a Chapel of Bones, consisting of bones of nearby cemeteries that were overcrowded. Monks have even been put into the walls—continuing the tradition

Évora is home to many cork trees, helping Portugal produce around 50% of the world's cork. These trees can be stripped every 9 years safely.

Just outside Évora, Almendres Cromlech features over 90 standing stones arranged in circles and ovals—believed to be a prehistoric astronomical observatory, dating back to 6000 BCE.

Winerys in Douro Valley store their Port barrels underground, in exposed to bedrock caves, ideal for aging.

# Templar
The Knights Templar had a strong presence in Portugal. After the order was dissolved in 1312, King Dinis formed the Order of Christ, allowing former Templars to continue under a new name. Their legacy is especially visible in Tomar, home to the Templar-built Convent of Christ, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
