## Day 1

Without any sleep, the first day consisted of checking in at our budget accommodation - Trinity College - who had decided to list all of their rooms for great prices in downtown Dublin. To keep things light we spent the rest of the day nearby and checked out the college itself - and the Book of Kells.
