## Day 1

The first day in Ireland consisted of checking in at our accomodations - Trinity College - who offered student rooms which ended up being dorms. With some free time we decided to explore around the nearby area, including Brampton street (which has no bars) and St. Patrick's Cathedral. The rest of the day maintained a slow pace with a walking tour of campus and seeing the book of Kells, which you cannot take pictures of.

## Day 2

Our first day trip in Ireland ended up being more action packed than I thought - when I booked it I thought it was only going to be a bus ride to Giant's Causeway and a small look at Belfast, but it ended up including a private Black Cab tour of the current politics (including a wall that closes every day) in Belfast. Alongside this was also Dunluce Castle, which provided some amazing views.

## Day 3 

On the third day we made our way to Galway. With some downtime we walked to a lighthouse near the citycenter, but it ended up being a waste treatment facility. The ocean was still a great view though.

## Day 4

Departing from Galway to nearby areas, the first stop was the Aran Islands - specifically Inisheer. This would end up being the cheapest place during the trip to buy Guinness at only â‚¬5, which made no sense.

## Day 5 

The second and last day trip from Galway was north this time, to the Kylemore Abbey.

## Day 6 

Back in Dublin, there were a few notable things to check out. Guinness, Jameson, and Kilmainham Gaol - a historical jail where leaders of the Irish revolution were executed (which really kickstarted the revolution).

## Day 7 

One of the more scenic days in Ireland, we ventured south to the Wicklow mountains and Kilkenny. Kilkenny, known for the medeival mile, is also the home of Smithwicks, a popular red ale in Ireland. We did later find out that Smithwicks is owned and brewed by the same parent company as Guinness, something that they do not tell you while at Guinness.
