# Why does there need to be a V3
The need for a new portfolio website arose when I realized I was not proud enough of my current site (v1) to display it on my LinkedIn or my resume. Despite being ugly though it was nonetheless on display pretty much everywhere. This original website served a simple purpose, to basically be a web view of my resume that made it look like I was a capable web developer.

Overtime this iteration of the site began to have more downfalls, making it apparent that a new site was needed. Since it was one of the first web projects I had ever worked on, it was not mobile friendly and broke often on new displays. Don't get me wrong, it did not have any px values, it just was not very well thought out. Abstract ideas like blocks floating on the page just did not make enough sense to work without Javascript, and frankly image centering and manipulation without Flex boxes made it quite atrocious. To combat this, a v2 was implemented with some more modern ideologies, but still without JavaScript to keep things simple.
