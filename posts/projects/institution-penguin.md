## Intro/Inspo

Tasked with creating a senior design project, we came up with the idea to make a web game that could feature some advanced technologies - such as being react native, CI/CD, API ready, and more. 

We also wanted to make this "educational" and decided to include some kind of topic we could base it off of. 

The final product was a web based game similar to Club Penguin, that talks about penguin habitat loss. Keeping it "educational", institution was added to the name for good measure.
