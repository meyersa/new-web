# Intro/Inspo

One undergraduate class, ITC466 Cloud Automation, had a final project to deploy something on AWS using a couple of services. The obvious solution here was to deploy a website to EC2 and have it connect to RDS - knocking out two big services pretty easily. 

# Conclusion 

Despite all this work, somehow we were the only group who actually deployed something to AWS.. but oh well. 

# Technologies
